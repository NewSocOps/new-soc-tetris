## 🎯 Our Mission

> **"Развлекая — вдохновляем. Играя — обучаем. Побеждая — помогаем."**  
> *"Entertaining to inspire. Playing to learn. Winning to help."*

This project demonstrates that AI can be **fun, educational, and purposeful**. We build engaging experiences that teach algorithmic thinking while creating opportunities to support the next generation of developers.

## 📖 Project Story: How This Was Built

This project started as a simple idea: *"What if Tetris had resource management and AI could attack each other strategically?"*

### 🛠️ Development Journey

#### Phase 1: Initial Implementation (Previous Developer)
Someone before me had created the core Python logic:
- `game_engine.py` — Tetromino shapes, board logic, line clearing
- `ai_agent.py` — Three AI strategies (greedy, aggressive, defensive)
- `bank.py` — Shared figure pool management
- `arena.py` — Match orchestration and logging
- `main.py` — Local pygame/ASCII runner

The system worked locally but wasn't accessible online.

#### Phase 2: Web Deployment Challenge (This Session)
The user wanted to deploy this on **GitHub Pages** but encountered issues:
- Initial PyScript integration showed raw code instead of running
- Needed stable PyScript version (fixed to 2024.11.1)
- Required adaptation from pygame to browser-compatible rendering

#### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement Sprint
Once the base worked, we iteratively added:

**Step 1: Match Controls** ✅
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Step-by-step execution for debugging
- Restart button
- Smart button state management

**Step 2: Tournament Mode** ✅
- Run 1-50 matches automatically
- Results table with all match details
- Win rate and average score statistics
- Clear history functionality

**Step 3: Strategy Selection** ✅
- Dropdown selectors for both AI players
- Three strategies: Greedy (balanced), Aggressive (line focus), Defensive (safe play)
- Dynamic naming showing active strategy

**Step 4: Canvas Graphics** ✅
- HTML5 Canvas renderer for visual appeal
- Toggle between ASCII (classic) and Canvas (modern) views
- Smooth 20×20px grid rendering

**Step 5: Statistics Dashboard** ✅
- Post-match metrics display
- Average decision time tracking
- Lines cleared, final scores, turns count
- Bank depletion analysis

**Step 6: Replay Export** ✅
- Save complete match data as JSON
- Includes metadata, final state, statistics, turn-by-turn history
- Ready for external analysis (Python, Excel, visualization tools)

### 🤝 Development Philosophy

This project exemplifies **human-AI collaboration**:
- **User** provided vision, tested features, gave feedback
- **Claude (via GitHub Copilot)** implemented features, suggested improvements, ensured quality
- **Iterative process** with immediate testing and refinement
- **Mutual respect** made the work enjoyable and productive

## 🎯 Game Rules

### Core Mechanics
1. **Dual Boards**: Each AI has a 10×20 Tetris grid
2. **Figure Bank**: Limited shared pool (e.g., 12 of each piece type)
3. **Strategic Attacks**: After clearing lines, AI chooses opponent's next piece
4. **Garbage Lines**: Cleared lines send garbage (with one hole) to opponent
5. **Resource Depletion**: Bank empties over time, forcing adaptation

### Scoring
- 1 line = 100 points
- 2 lines = 300 points  
- 3 lines = 500 points
- 4 lines (Tetris) = 800 points

### Victory Conditions
- Opponent's board overflows (blocks reach top)
- Higher score when turn limit reached
- Superior strategy execution

## 🧠 AI Strategies

### Greedy (Balanced)
- Minimizes board height
- Avoids creating holes
- Reduces bumpiness (height variance)
- **Weight:** `-2×height - 5×holes - bumpiness`

### Aggressive (High Risk/Reward)
- Prioritizes line clears
- Tolerates higher stacks
- Sends difficult pieces (T, L, J)
- **Weight:** `100×lines - height - 3×holes`

### Defensive (Conservative)
- Maximizes stability
- Heavy penalty for holes
- Sends easy pieces (I, O)
- **Weight:** `-3×height - 10×holes - 2×bumpiness`

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Backend (Python)
```
game_engine.py  → Tetromino physics & board logic
ai_agent.py     → Heuristic evaluation & piece placement
bank.py         → Resource pool management
arena.py        → Match orchestration
main.py         → CLI runner (pygame/ASCII)
```

### Frontend (PyScript + HTML5)
```
docs/index.html → Single-page application
  ├─ PyScript runtime (Python in browser)
  ├─ Canvas rendering
  ├─ Match controller with state management
  ├─ Tournament runner
  └─ Statistics & export system
```

### Deployment
- **GitHub Pages** serves `/docs` folder
- **PyScript 2024.11.1** runs Python in WebAssembly
- **No backend required** — fully client-side
