# AI vs AI Tetris Arena with Figure Bank

## üéÆ Overview
This project implements a **Tetris-style competitive arena** where two AI agents battle each other.  
Unlike classic Tetris, the game introduces a **shared Figure Bank** mechanic:  
- Each AI draws pieces from a limited pool.  
- After placing a piece, an AI selects the next piece for its opponent.  
- As the bank depletes, attacking ‚Äúsmartly‚Äù becomes harder, forcing adaptive strategies.  

The result is a hybrid of **Tetris + resource management + adversarial AI combat**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Rules

1. **Game Board**
   - Each AI has its own 10√ó20 grid.  
   - Pieces fall from the top; AIs decide placement and rotation.  

2. **Figure Bank**
   - Initialized with a finite pool (e.g., 15 of each tetromino).  
   - When a piece is used, it is removed from the bank.  
   - If the bank is empty, the game falls back to a random generator.  

3. **Attacks**
   - After placing a piece, an AI chooses a figure from the bank to send to the opponent.  
   - If the chosen figure is unavailable, another must be selected.  
   - Clearing lines sends garbage lines to the opponent.  

4. **Scoring**
   - 1 line = 100 points  
   - 2 lines = 300 points  
   - 3 lines = 500 points  
   - 4 lines (Tetris) = 800 points  

5. **Victory**
   - The game ends when one board overflows.  
   - Winner = the AI with the higher score or the last survivor.

## ü§ñ AI Strategies
- **Greedy**: minimize stack height.  
- **Aggressive**: maximize attacks by sending difficult pieces.  
- **Defensive**: prioritize survival and stability.

## üìä Logging
- JSON logs include:
  - Moves taken  
  - Time per decision  
  - Bank state after each turn  
  - Attack effectiveness

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the game in **pygame mode**:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
4. Run in **ASCII mode** (headless):  
   ```bash
   python main.py --ascii
   ```

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
- [ ] Add replay saving and playback.  
- [ ] Add configurable AI parameters.  
- [ ] Add tournament mode (multiple matches with statistics).  
- [ ] Improve visualization with animations and sound.
